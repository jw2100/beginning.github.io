What is Machine Learning?

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

另一个例子：垃圾邮件为例
E=联系把邮件分为垃圾邮件或者正常邮件
T=把一个邮件定为垃圾邮件或者非垃圾邮件
P=把邮件正确分为垃圾邮件或正常邮件的数量

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

除了监督学习和无监督学习，还有强化学习和推进系统也是机器学习的一员

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

监督学习：Supervised Learning：

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.（就是通过给定的数据和已知的输出，预测未来的输入对应的输出）

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. 
回归问题：In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. 
分类问题：In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.(预测到离散输出：映射输入到离散的分类)

Example 1:

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price." Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.
(以下房价基于面积，根据真实房价，预测一个房子的价格，是回归问题；判断房子卖多了还是卖少了，是分类问题)

Example 2:
(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture
(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor肿瘤, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant恶性 or benign良性.

无监督学习：Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.（根据数据之间的关系，推导出数据结构）

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.（无监督学习不会基于预测结果进行反馈）

Example:

Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).（提取）

[无监督学习 ： 聚类问题、鸡尾酒宴问题。。。。。。]
[W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x');

线性回归算法：

后面假设 M=训练集中数据个数
		 X=输入变量或者特征 Xi 第i个输入
		 Y=输出或者目标变量 Yi  第i个输出
		h代表一个函数或者假设（hypothesis）

hθ(x)=θ0+θ1*x
这个模型被称为线性回归(linear regression)模型
因为只有一个变量x，也可叫单变量线性回归



To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:

When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


代价函数Cost Function （平方误差函数/平方误差代价函数）

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.


To break it apart, it is 12 x¯ where x¯ is the mean of the squares of hθ(xi)−yi , or the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

This function is otherwise called the "Squared error function", or "Mean squared error". The mean is halved (12) as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the 12 term. The following image summarizes what the cost function does:
